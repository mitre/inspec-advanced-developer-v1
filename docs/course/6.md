## 6. Advanced techniques in profile development
### 6.1. rspec Explicit Subject
Here we have a inspec test that lists out it's current directory. Our original test code looks like this
```ruby
describe command('ls -al').stdout.strip do
  it { should_not be_empty }
end
```

If we would like to have a more [Explicit Subject](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/subject/explicit-subject) then we could refactor the code like this example
```ruby
describe "this is a detailed message" do
  subject { command('ls -al').stdout.strip }
  it{ should_not be_empty }
end
```

### 6.2. looping file structure
For looping through a file directory, the directory resource is not powerful enough to do that, so we are required to use the `command` resource and run a `find` or it's equivalent for your target OS. This can be very resource intensive on your target so try to be as specific as possible with your search such as the example below:
```ruby
command('find ~/* -type f -maxdepth 0 -xdev').stdout.split.each do |fname|
  describe file(fname) do
    its('owner') { should cmp 'ec2-user' }
  end
end
```

### 6.3. Checking password encryption
Here we have an inspec test that checks if passwords are SHA512 hashes. As a quick thought exercise can you think of how we can adjust the control below to support SHA512 or higher assuming where you are testing uses SHA1024 or even SHA2048?

```ruby
bad_users = inspec.shadow.where { password != "*" && password != "!" && password !~ /\$6\$/ }.users

describe 'Password hashes in /etc/shadow' do
  it 'should only contain SHA512 hashes' do
    failure_message = "Users without SHA512 hashes: #{bad_users.join(', ')}"
    expect(bad_users).to be_empty, failure_message
  end
end
```
