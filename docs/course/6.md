## 6. Explore the basics of a resource
### 6.1. class
The class is where the ruby file is defined.
### 6.2. name
The name is how we will call upon this resource within our controls, in the example above that would be `gordon_config`.
### 6.3. supports
Supports are used to define/restrict the ruby resource to work in specific ways, as shown in the example above that is used to restrict our class to specific platforms.
### 6.4. desc & examples
desc is used as a simple in code description of the purpose of this resource while the example is to show how the resource can be used in a control.
### 6.5. initialize method
The initialize method is necessary because in inspec controls when we pass a parameter the ruby class for the resource must have an initialize method to be defined to accept that paraemeter.
### 6.6. functionality methods
These are the methods that perform the actions you require the resource to perform.
