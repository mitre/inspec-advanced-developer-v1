## 8. Creating a custom resource: the git example
### 8.1. Create new InSpec profile
Let's start by creating a new profile:
```bash
inspec init profile git
```
### 8.2. Develop controls to test / run profile
Now let's write some controls and test that they run:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2018, The Authors

git_dir = "/home/chef/apache/.git"

# The following banches should exist
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /master/ }
end

describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /testBranch/ }
end

# What is the current branch
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /^\* master/ }
end

# What is the latest commit
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} log -1 --pretty=format:'%h'") do
  its('stdout') { should match /24b4fa0/ }
end

# What is the second to last commit
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'") do
  its('stdout') { should match /500c9fb/ }
end
```

### 8.3. Rewrite test
Let's rewrite the first test in our example file as follows:
```ruby
# The following banches should exist
describe git(git_dir) do
  its('branches') { should include 'master' }
end
```
Now let's run the profile
```bash
inspec exec git
```
We should get an error because the git method and resource are not defined yet
### 8.4. Develop git resources
Let's start by creating a new file called git.rb in the libraries directory, the content of the file should look like this:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

end
```
Now run the profile again
```bash
inspec exec git
```
This time we get another error letting us know that we have a resource that has been given the incorrect number of arguments. This means we have given an additional parameter to this resource that we have not yet accepted.

Each resource will require an initialization method.

For our git.rb file lets add that initialization method:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

end
```
This is saving the path we are passing in from the control into an instance method called path.

Now when we run the profile
```bash
inspec exec git
```
The test will run but we will get an error saying we do not have a "branches" method.

So let's go back to our git.rb file to fix that by adding a `branches` method:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches

    end

end
```
We have now defined the branches method. Let's see what the test output shows us.
```bash
inspec exec git
```

Now the error message says that the branches method is returning a null value when it's expecting an array or something that is able to accept the include method invoked on it

We can use the inspec helper method which enables you to invoke any other inspec resource as seen below:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches
        inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout
    end

end
```
Now we see that we get a passing test!

Now let's adjust our test to also check for our second branch that we created earlier as well as check our current branch:
```ruby
# The following banches should exist
describe git(git_dir) do
  its('branches') { should include 'master' }
  its('branches') { should include 'testBranch' }
  its('current_branch') { should cmp 'master' }
end
```

Let's head over to the git.rb file to create the current_branch method we are invoking in the above test:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches
        inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout
    end

    def current_branch
        branch_name = inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout.strip.split("\n").find do |name|
            name.start_with?('*')
        end
        branch_name.gsub(/^\*/,'').strip
    end

end
```

Now we can run the profile again
```bash
inspec exec git
```
All the tests should pass!

**EXERCISE:**  
As a solo exercise, try to create a method in the git.rb file to check what the last commit is.
