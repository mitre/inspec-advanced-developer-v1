## 9. Creating a custom resource: the docker example
### 9.1. Create new profile and setup docker files
First lets write our docker compose file `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  workstation:
    container_name: workstation
    image: learnchef/inspec_workstation
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    links:
      - target
    volumes:
      - .:/root
  target:
    image: learnchef/inspec_target
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

We will continue writing our controls to check against this docker file
```bash
inspec init profile docker-workstations
```

### 9.2. Develop controls to test/run profile
In the `controls/example.rb` file, write the control

```ruby
describe yaml('file_name') do
  its('setting') { should_not eq 'value' }
end
```

We need to replace the `file_name` above with the location of the `docker-compose.yml` file. We also need to change the `setting` to grab the tag we want to retrieve. Finally we need to change `value` with the actual value as shown in the docker compose file.

```ruby
describe yaml('/path/to/docker-compose.yml') do
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'image']) { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'volumes']) { should cmp '.:/root' }
end
```

Now if we test this control using the following command we should see all the tests pass

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

### 9.3. Rewrite test to utilize resource
Going back to the control, we will write it using a resource that doesn't exist called docker-compose-config that is going to take a path as a parameter.

```ruby
describe yaml('/path/to/docker-compose.yml') do
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'image']) { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'volumes']) { should cmp '.:/root' }
end

describe docker_compose_config('/path/to/docker-compose.yml') do
  its('services.workstation.image') { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its('services.workstation.volumes') { should cmp '.:/root' }
end
```

Now we should see an error if we go back to terminal and run the same command to execute a scan

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

We should get an error saying the `docker_compose_config` method does not yet exist. That's because we have not yet defined this resource.

### 9.4. Develop docker resource
In the `libraries` directory of the profile we will make a `docker_compose_config.rb` file, , the content of the file should look like this:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

end
```

Now when we save and run the profile again using:

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

We will get an error saying we gave it the wrong number of arguments: was given 1 but expected 0. This is because every class in ruby that has a parameter must have an initialize function to accept that parameter.

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
  end

end
```

Now let's run the profile once more

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

This time the profile runs, but we get a message that the `docker_compose_config` resource does not have the `services` method. So let's define that method now:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
  end

  def services

  end

end
```

Start by just defining the `services` method then lets run the profile once more.

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

Now we got a different failure that a NIL value was returned. So now we will go ahead and define the services method. We will use an already existing inspec resource to parse the path file.

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
    @yaml = inspec.yaml(path)
  end

  def services
    @yaml['services']
  end

end
```

Now let's run the profile once more

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

You will notice that it parses it correctly but instead of our result we end up getting a hash. We need to convert the hash into an object that appears like other objects so that we may use our dot notation. So we will wrap our hash in a Hashie mash, this is a quick way to convert a hash into a ruby object with a number of methods attached to it and is written as follows:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
    @yaml = inspec.yaml(path)
  end

  def services
    Hashie::Mash.new @yaml['services']
  end

end
```

Lets run the profile again

```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

Everything passed!
