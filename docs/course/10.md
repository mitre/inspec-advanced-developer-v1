## 10. FilterTable exercise: Using FilterTable to write a Resource

### 10.1. When do I use FilterTable?

FilterTable is intended to help you author "plural" resources with **stucture data**.

Plural resources examine platform objects in bulk. 
For example, 

- sorting through which packages are installed on a system, or 
- which virtual machines are on a cloud provider. 
- all processes running more than an hour, or all VMs on a particular subnet.




```ruby

inspec> etc_hosts.entries
=> 
[#<struct  ip_address="127.0.0.1", primary_name="localhost", all_host_names=["localhost", "localhost.localdomain", "localhost4", "localhost4.localdomain4"]>,
 #<struct  ip_address="::1", primary_name="localhost6", all_host_names=["localhost6", "localhost6.localdomain6"]>,
 #<struct  ip_address="127.0.0.1", primary_name="test1.org", all_host_names=["test1.org"]>,
 #<struct  ip_address="127.0.0.1", primary_name="test2.org", all_host_names=["test2.org"]>,
 #<struct  ip_address="127.0.0.1", primary_name="test3.org", all_host_names=["test3.org"]>,
 #<struct  ip_address="127.0.0.1", primary_name="test4.org", all_host_names=["test4.org"]>]

```

#### 10.1.1. May I have multiple FilterTable installations on a class?

In theory, yes - that would be used to implement different data fetching / caching strategies.  It is a very advanced usage, and no core resources currently do this, as far as I know.


#### 10.1.2. How do I declare my interaction with FilterTable? (Hands On)

* Create new profile
```
inspec init profile filtertable-test
```
* Place following file as custom resource in `libraries` directory as `filter.rb`.

```ruby
require 'inspec/utils/filter'

class Filtertable < Inspec.resource(1)
  name "filtertable"
  supports platform: "linux"

  # FilterTable setup
  filter_table = FilterTable.create
  # assign fields
  filter_table.register_column(:name, field: :name)
  filter_table.register_column(:age, field: :age)
  filter_table.register_column(:gender, field: :gender)
  filter_table.register_column(:toys, field: :toys)

  # custom matchers
  filter_table.register_custom_matcher(:has_car?) { |filter_table| filter_table.toys.flatten.include?('car') }
  filter_table.register_custom_matcher(:boy?)     { |filter_table| filter_table.gender.uniq.eql?(['boy']) }
  filter_table.register_custom_matcher(:girl?)    { |filter_table| filter_table.gender.uniq.eql?(['girl']) }
  
  # custom property
  filter_table.register_custom_property(:boys_count)  { |filter_table| filter_table.where(gender: 'boy').count }
  filter_table.register_custom_property(:girls_count) { |filter_table| filter_table.where(gender: 'girl').count }

  # bind to structured data
  filter_table.install_filter_methods_on_resource(self, :fetch_data)


  def fetch_data
    # This method should return an array of hashes - the raw data.  We'll hardcode it here.
    [
      { name: "Sarah", age: 12,  gender: "girl", toys: ['car','train','bike']},
      { name: "John",  age: 9,   gender: "boy",  toys: ['top','bike']},
      { name: "Donny", age: 10,  gender: "boy",  toys: ['bike','train','nintento']},
      { name: "Mary",  age: 12,  gender: "girl", toys: ['car','gameboy','bike']},
    ]
  end
end
```

#### 10.1.3. Run inspec shell with custom resource

```
inspec shell --depends /path/to/profile/root/
```
### 10.2. Standard behavior

With a (fairly standard) implementation like that above, what behavior do you get out of the box?

#### 10.2.1. Some things are defined for you

These methods are now installed automatically: `where`, `entries`, `raw_data`, `count`, and `exist?`.  You only have to declare your columns unique to your resource, and then attach the data fetcher.

#### 10.2.2. Custom Matcher Examples
- `has_car?
```ruby
describe filtertable.where( name: "Donny" ) do
  it { should have_car }
end  

Profile: inspec-shell
Version: (not specified)

  filtertable with name == "Donny"
     ×  should have car
     expected #has_car? to return true, got false

Test Summary: 0 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```
```ruby
describe filtertable.where( name: "Sarah" ) do
  it { should have_car }  
end  

Profile: inspec-shell
Version: (not specified)

  filtertable with name == "Sarah"
     ✔  should have car

Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped

```
- girl?
```ruby
describe filtertable.where( name: "Sarah" ) do
  it { should be_girl }  
end  

Profile: inspec-shell
Version: (not specified)

  filtertable with name == "Sarah"
     ✔  should be girl

Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped

```


#### 10.2.3. Custom Property
- girls_count
```ruby
describe filtertable do
  its('girls_count') { should cmp 1 }
end  

Profile: inspec-shell
Version: (not specified)

  filtertable
     ×  girls_count should cmp == 1
     
     expected: 1
          got: 2
     
     (compared using `cmp` matcher)


Test Summary: 0 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```
- boys_count
```ruby
describe filtertable do
  its('boys_count') { should cmp 2 }
end  

Profile: inspec-shell
Version: (not specified)

  filtertable
     ✔  boys_count should cmp == 2

Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped

```

### 10.3. Suggested activity
- **Add a field to the data array and reflect the change in filter table**
- **Add a custom matcher**
- **Add a custom property**
- **Write controls examples of each filter table tricks shown below**


#### 10.3.1. A `where` method you can call with hash params, with loose matching

If you call `where` as a method with no block and passing hash params, with keys you know are in the raw data, it will fetch the raw data, then filter row-wise and return the resulting Table.

Multiple criteria are joined with a logical AND.

The filtering is fancy, not just straight equality.

```ruby
  describe things.where(color: 'red') do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
  end

  # Regexes
  describe things.where(color: /^re/) do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
  end

  # It eventually falls out to === comparison
  # Here, range membership 1..2
  describe things.where(thing_id: (1..2)) do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
  end

  # Things that don't exist are silently ignored, but do not match
  describe things.where(none_such: 'nope') do
    its('count') { should cmp 0 }
  end

  # irregular rows are supported
  # Only one row has the :tackiness key, with value 'very'.
  describe things.where(tackiness: 'very') do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
  end

```

#### 10.3.2. A `where` method you can call with a block, referencing some fields

You can also call the `where` method with a block. The block is executed row-wise. If it returns truthy, the row is included in the results. register_custom_propertyitionally, within the block each field declared with the `register_custom_property` configuration method is available as a data accessor.

```ruby

  # You can have any logic you want in the block
  describe things.where { true } do
    its('count') { should cmp 3 }
  end

  # You can access any fields you declared using `register_column`
  describe things.where { thing_id > 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
  end
```

#### 10.3.3. You can chain off of `where` or any other Table without re-fetching raw data

The first time `where` is called, the data fetcher method is called.  `where` performs filtration on the raw data table.  It then constructs a new FilterTable::Table, directly passing in the filtered raw data; this is then the return value from `where`.

```ruby
  # This only calls fetch_data once
  describe things.where(color: :red).where { thing_id > 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
  end
```

Some other methods return a Table object, and they may be chained without a re-fetch as well.

#### 10.3.4. An `entries` method that will return an array of Structs

The other `register_filter_method` call enables a pre-defined method, `entries`.  `entries` is much simpler than `where` - in fact, its behavior is unrelated.  It returns an encapsulated version of the raw data - a plain array, containing Structs as row-entries.  Each struct has an attribute for each time you called `register_column`.

Overall, in my opinion, `entries` is less useful than `params` (which returns the raw data).  Wrapping in Structs does not seem to add much benefit.

Importantly, note that the return value of `entries` is not the resource, nor the Table - in other words, you cannot chain it. However, you can call `entries` on any Table.

If you call `entries` without chaining it after `where`, calling entries will trigger the call to the data fetching method.

```ruby

  # Access the entries array
  describe things.entries do
    # This is Array#count, not the resource's `count` method
    its('count') { should cmp 3}
  end

  # Access the entries array after chaining off of where
  describe things.where(color: :red).entries do
    # This is Array#count, not the resource's or table's `count` method
    its('count') { should cmp 2}
  end

  # You can access the struct elements as a method, as a hash keyed on symbol, or as a hash keyed on string
  describe things.entries.first.color do
    it { should cmp :red }
  end
  describe things.entries.first[:color] do
    it { should cmp :red }
  end
  describe things.entries.first['color'] do
    it { should cmp :red }
  end
```

#### 10.3.5. You get an `exist?` matcher defined on the resource and the table

This `register_custom_matcher` call:
```ruby
filter_table_config.register_custom_matcher(:exist?) { |filter_table| !filter_table.entries.empty? }
```

causes a new method to be defined on both the resource class and the Table class.  The body of the method is taken from the block that is provided.  When the method it called, it will receive the FilterTable::Table instance as its first parameter.  (It may also accept a second param, but that doesn't make sense for this method - see thing_ids).

As when you are implementing matchers on a singular resource, the only thing that distinguishes this as a matcher is the fact that it ends in `?`.

```ruby
  # Bare call on the matcher (called as a method on the resource)
  describe things do
    it { should exist }
  end

  # Chained on where (called as a method on the Table)
  describe things.where(color: :red) do
    it { should exist }
  end
```

#### 10.3.6. You get an `count` property defined on the resource and the table

This `register_custom_property` call:
```ruby
filter_table_config.register_custom_property(:count) { |filter_table| filter_table.entries.count }
```

causes a new method to be defined on both the resource class and the Table class.  As with `exists?`, the body is taken from the block.

```ruby
  # Bare call on the property (called as a method on the resource)
  describe things do
    its('count') { should cmp 3 }
  end

  # Chained on where (called as a method on the Table)
  describe things.where(color: :red) do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
  end
```

#### 10.3.7. A `thing_ids` method that will return an array of plain values when called without params

This `register_column` call:
```ruby
filter_table_config.register_column(:thing_ids, field: :thing_id)
```

will cause a method to be defined on both the resource and the Table. Note that this `register_column` call does not provide a block; so FilterTable::Factory generates a method body.  The `:field` option specifies which column to access in the raw data (that is, which hash key in the array-of-hashes).

The implementation provided by Factory changes behavior based on calling pattern.  If no params or block is provided, a simple array is returned, containing the column-wise values in the raw data.

```ruby

  # Use it to check for presence / absence of a member
  # This retains nice output formatting - we're testing on a Table associated with a Things resource
  describe things.where(color: :red) do
    its('thing_ids') { should include 3 }
  end

  # Equivalent but with poor formatting - we're testing an anonymous array
  describe things.where(color: :red).thing_ids do
    it { should include 3 }
  end

  # Use as a test-less enumerator
  things.where(color: :red).thing_ids.each do |thing_id|
    # Do something with thing_id, maybe
    # describe thing(thing_id) do ...
  end

  # Can be used without where - enumerates all Thing IDs with no filter
  things.thing_ids.each do |thing_id|
    # Do something with thing_id, maybe
    # describe thing(thing_id) do ...
  end

```

#### 10.3.8. A `colors` method that will return a flattened and uniq'd array of values

This method behaves just like `thing_ids`, except that it returns the values of the `color` column.

```ruby
  # Three rows in the data: red, blue, red
  describe things.colors do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
    it { should include :red }
    it { should include :blue }
  end

```

#### 10.3.9. A `colors` method that can filter on a value and return a Table

You also get this for `thing_ids`.  

People definitely use this in the wild.  It reads badly to me; I think this is a legacy usage that we should consider deprecating. To me, this seems to imply that there is a sub-resource (here, colors) we are auditing.  At least two core resouces (`xinetd_conf` and `users`) advocate this as their primary use.

```ruby
  # Filter on colors
  describe things.colors(:red) do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
  end

  # Same, but doesn't imply we're now operating on some 'color' resource
  describe things.where(color: :red) do
    its('count') { should cmp 2 }
  end
```

#### 10.3.10. A `colors` method that can filter on a block and return a Table

You also get this for `thing_ids`. 
I haven't seen this used in the wild, but its existence gives me a headache.

```ruby
  # Example A, B, C, and D are semantically the same

  # A: Filter both on colors and the block
  describe things.colors(:red) { thing_id < 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
    its('thing_ids') { should include 1 }
  end

  # B use one where block
  describe things.where { color == :red && thing_id < 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
    its('thing_ids') { should include 1 }
  end

  # C use two where blocks
  describe things.where { color == :red }.where { thing_id < 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
    its('thing_ids') { should include 1 }
  end

  # D use a where param and a where block
  describe things.where(color: :red) { thing_id < 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
    its('thing_ids') { should include 1 }
  end

  # This has nothing to do with colors at all, and may be broken - the lack of an arg to `colors` may make it never match
  describe things.colors { thing_id < 2 } do
    its('count') { should cmp 1 }
  end
```

#### 10.3.11. You can call `params` or `raw_data` on any Table to get the raw data

People _definitely_ use this out in the wild. Unlike `entries`, which wraps each row in a Struct and omits undeclared fields, `raw_data` simply returns the actual raw data array-of-hashes.  It is not `dup`'d.

```ruby
  tacky_things = things.where(color: :blue).raw_data.select { |row| row[:tackiness] }
  tacky_things.map { |row| row[:thing_id] }.each do |thing_id|
    # Use to audit a singular Thing
    describe thing(thing_id) do
      it { should_not be_paisley }
    end
  end
```

#### 10.3.12. You can call `resource_instance` on any Table to get the resource instance

You could use this to do something fairly complicated.

```ruby
  describe things.where do # Just getting a Table object
    its('resource_instance.some_method') { should cmp 'some_value' }
  end
```

However, the resource instance won't know about the filtration, so I'm not sure what good this does.  Chances are, someone is doing something horrid using this feature in the wild.
