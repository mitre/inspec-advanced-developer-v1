### 2.2. InSpec Controls Structure
```ruby
control "V-13727" do
  title "The worker_processes StartServers directive must be set properly."

  desc "These requirements are set to mitigate the effects of several types of
  denial of service attacks. Although there is some latitude concerning the
  settings themselves, the requirements attempt to provide reasonable limits
  for the protection of the web server. If necessary, these limits can be
  adjusted to accommodate the operational requirement of a given system."

  impact 0.5
  tag "severity": "medium"
  tag "gtitle": "WA000-WWA026"
  tag "gid": "V-13727"
  tag "rid": "SV-36645r2_rule"
  tag "stig_id": "WA000-WWA026 A22"
  tag "nist": ["CM-6", "Rev_4"]

  tag "check": "To view the worker_processes directive value enter the
  following command:
  grep ""worker_processes"" on the nginx.conf file and any separate included
  configuration files
  If the value of ""worker_processes"" is not set to auto or explicitly set,
  this is a finding:
  worker_processes   auto;
  worker_processes defines the number of worker processes. The optimal value
  depends on many factors including (but not limited to) the number of CPU
  cores, the number of hard disk drives that store data, and load pattern. When
  one is in doubt, setting it to the number of available CPU cores would be a
  good start (the value “auto” will try to autodetect it)."

  tag "fix": "Edit the configuration file and set the value of
  ""worker_processes"" to the value of auto or a value of 1 or higher:
  worker_processes auto;"

  describe nginx_conf(NGINX_CONF_FILE).params['worker_processes'] do
    it { should cmp [['auto']] }
  end
end
```

### 2.5. InSpec Resources
```ruby

  name 'gordon_config'

  # Restrict to only run on the below platforms (if none were given, all OS's supported)
  supports platform_family: 'fedora'
  supports platform: 'centos', release: '6.9'
  # Supports `*` for wildcard matcher in the release
  supports platform: 'centos', release: '7.*'

  desc '
    Resource description ...

  example '
    describe gordon_config do
      its("signal") { should eq "on" }
    end
  '

  # Load the configuration file on initialization
  def initialize(path = nil)
    @path = path || '/etc/gordon.conf'
    @params = SimpleConfig.new( read_content )
  end

  # Expose all parameters of the configuration file.
  def method_missing(name)
    @params[name]
  end

  private

  def read_content
    f = inspec.file(@path)
    # Test if the path exist and that it's a file
    if f.file?
      # Retrieve the file's contents
      f.content
    else
      # If the file doesn't exist, skip all tests that use gordon_config
      raise Inspec::Exceptions::ResourceSkipped, "Can't read config at #{@path}"
