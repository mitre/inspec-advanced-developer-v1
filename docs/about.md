# About the Course

A hands-on InSpec developer course.

After attending this course the student will be able to:  

- Describe the InSpec framework and its capabilities
- Describe the architecture of an InSpec profile   
- Build an InSpec profile to transform security policy into automated security testing
- Run an InSpec profile against a component of an application stack
- View and analyze InSpec results
- Report results

We will be spending most of the course hands-on working with the tools and in the Unix command line, so as to grow an understanding of how InSpec actually works.

Don't fixate on the tools used, nor the specific use cases we develop in the course, instead focus on learning the how and why.  How and why is far more important.  This course is not about tools although we'll be using them. You'll spend far more time writing code.  (Or at least cutting-and-pasting code.)
